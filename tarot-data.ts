He may represent entrepreneurialism, cleverness, or resourcefulness. When this card appears in a spread, consider if in the context of the issue at hand, if the querent indeed has everything already at hand that is needed to achieve the desired goal."

    "details":"Third card of the Major Arcana, The High Priestess is, above all, cloistered with her book or Knowledge. She is studying in solitude and has attained a great deal of knowledge. The risk here is becoming stuck in this state of study and never applying one's knowledge. Where the Magician stands at his table because he dares, she sits, because she knows."

    "details":"The Empress energy rushes organically and untempered into being. She is like the young person who, new to adulthood, goes forward into the world enthusiastically. She can also be likened to the creative force of the earth, in which seeds germinate within her and spring forth, covering every bit of ground. She is enthusiasm and creativity in all its aspects. She can be in a huge force such as a national obsession with a new dance or something subtle like the flirtatious glance of someone irresistible."

    "details":"The Pope is an emissary. He bridges that which is here and that which is there. He can represent a mediator or even a middle man. At his best, he is that which motivates us toward the transcendental while keeping one foot on the ground. He can connect with and channel that energy represented by the phrase 'the word made flesh'. He can inspire in us divine, genuine emotion brought into physical reality. He helps us understand how to apply higher knowledge to our daily lives. At his worst, he can represent an abuse of power."

    "details":"The Lover (notice that that is singular, not plural), faces us with choices. We know what we love yet often, we do the opposite. Why? This card asks you to examine this. The Lover can encompass all things related to how we connect with or relate to siblings, lovers, and community. Do we feel cast out, included, loved, passionate, overwhelmed, etc.? The Lover can also have to do with work and doing what you love."

    "details":"The Chariot does not control the horses. His energy compliments that of the Empress. Where she is the enthusiastic recipient of the seed, he is the giver of it - going forward and sowing it wherever he can. He conquers new territory like the entrepreneur. He doesn't know the land he intends on dominating until he has arrived, but that makes no difference. He moves like the tide, changing the landscape indiscriminately and profoundly."

She holds a sword representing clarity of thought and scales for weighing the truth. She looks at the viewer straight on and unflinchingly. At the same time, notice that almost everything in the image is askew - her necklace, the sword and the scales. This shows us that nothing in the Universe is divided into equal portions and that that is the Truth. Some people are smarter than others, richer, more fortunate, etc. Justice shows us that we have to face this reality."

    "details":"The Hermit, as all the cards, can represent a range of related things. For example, he can be seen as a wise elder, treading a path that few dare. At the same time, he could be seen as a crochety old man who doesn't want anyone disturbing his peace and who cannot see other than that which is right before him that he chooses to light with his lamp."

It is a time to take stock of what has happened and what we are setting up to happen on the next time around. Are we making changes for the better or are we doomed to repeat due to ignorance?"

In the first round (The Fool and the Magician), we were just starting out and managed to collect all the things we needed to support our journey. This time around, we have the experience of all the prior cards in the Major Arcana behind us. Now, we are prepared to tame the beast we face in our journey. This can be the mind for meditators, second chakra wounds for abuse survivors, fault-finding for the critical, an addiction, and so on. In order to face our demons, we need Strength and creativity. We must address our problem deliberately and with a calm determiniation. Strength underscores that inner strength is a reflection of as above, so below'."

    "card_group":"Major Arcana",
    "keyword": "Letting Go, Meditation, Introspection ",
    "details":"The Hanged Man lets go of a desire to control. He learns Truth by silencing his will to that which is. There is a story that the Norse god, Odin, hung from the tree Yggdrasil, sacrificing himself for wisdom. He let go of everything, refusing any comfort from the gods. He gazed into the dark waters of the well from which the tree grew and after 9 days, the Runes revealed themselves to him. He went forward in great wisdom and power after this revelation. In order to learn wisdom, we have to learn to quiet our will, cultivate humility and listen."

    "card_group":"Major Arcana",
    "keyword": "Revolution, Renewal, Out With the Old",
    "details":"XIII, The Nameless Arcanum, is a powerful force in our lives. Though some people fearfully see this card as death or misfortune, this is mistaken and short-sighted. We have all had (and will continue to have) upheaval in our lives. Sometimes it's small, sometimes our whole lives change, but it is not always a negative. Sometimes, we continue a relationship or behavior simply because it is less scary than the unknown. We keep the bandage on out of fear of removing it and healing fully. When this card appears in a reading, it indicates the energy of clearing out that which no longer serves us. As the saying goes, 'you can go by wisdom or by woe, but you're going'. The energy of this card can be seen as the other side of that of the Empress. We simply cannot move forward with new growth in our lives when there is clutter from the past in the way."

    "keyword": "The Middle Way, Guidance, Protection, Divine Inspiration, Equanimity",
    "details":"Temperance shows an angel whose feet are firmly on the ground - that is a heavenly being who is acting in the world. This card reflects the concept of being in the world but not of it. There is a Buddhist description of the realization of emptiness that describes the mind and emptiness 'mixing as water with water' in which the two become indistinguishable. If we realize temperance, or this way of treading lightly, not being at the mercy of our fleeting desires, we become conduits of kindness and compassion for ourselves and others."

    "details":"The Devil can represent contracts or anything we might be attached to.

    "shortname":"16_MaisonDieu",
    "card_group":"Major Arcana",
    "keyword": "Sudden Change, Release, Freedom, Celebration",
    "details":"In the Rider-Waite Tarot, many people associate the Tower with negativity because we fundamentally fear sudden change. The imagery here is clearly from the Tower of Babel in the Bible, however, in the story, God did not strike down the tower in a sudden lightning strike - he caused all the people to suddenly speak disparate languages. After that, they dispersed and according to the story this is the origin of the many languages in the world. Just as XII The Hanged Man comes from an earlier story but does not continue the analogy through runic inscriptions or Norse imagery, so too, does the Tower of Babel here provide jumping off point for us. These people are not going out into the world speaking all the languages we know today. They are simply leaving a tower. How we read it is up to our interprative practice. The colored circles falling all around can be likened to confetti, manna or blessings. The people can be read as being relieved of their imprisonment and the swirling burst at the top of the tower could be seen as exiting it rather than coming from above. The whole scenario can be seen as Plato's 'Allegory of the Cave'. Always consider the spectrum of experience. A government falling can be a release for the people or the end of a dictator's life. The negativity or positivity relies entirely on perception."

    "keyword": "Finding One's Place, Waterways, Comfort, Guided Knowing",
    "details":"The Star has found her place on the Earth and brings altruism and blessing. Traditionally, this card is associated with inspiration, hope and generosity. The woman is led by intuition, her connection to that which is, and through this inspiration, pours life-giving water onto the Earth. She is calm and knowing. Feeling flows freely, without upsetting her equanimity. On the other end of the spectrum, this card can be interpreted as waste. Elements of the Earth and its wellbeing in addition to divinely inspired giving are major themes of this card."

    "details":"The Moon is in some Tarot traditions viewed as fear and being lost, however, the Moon offers herself as a light in the darkness. Though she waxes and wanes, she teaches lessons in all of her phases. The deep night is where we delve into our own subconscious and where it can be frightening, it is when done with wisdom and determination, a path to Truth."

    "keyword": "New Construction, Being Guided, Companionship, Encouragement",
    "details":"The Sun signals new construction (notice the wall in the background) and the two figures in the foreground reference the two figures in XV The Devil. Instead of being chained to the devil they know, they have thrown off their shackles and have discovered a new way. One of the two guides the other, who, especially in the Jodorowsky-Camoin deck appears to be blind. Often, when we embark on something new that we know is promising, we may still have some reservations."

    "details":"Judgement denotes an irresistible desire or vocation. It can also be concerned with birth or a new consciousness coming into being or a renaissance. It has also been connected with music, transcendence and the emergence of something new. Another way to look at this card could be comparable to that of a butterfly emerging from its chryslalis. All of that said, there is still more imagery to take into account. It could be interpreted as the work of a pair of people coming to fruition or even quite literally in terms of passing on to the next phase and meeting the Divine on a day of reckoning."

    "keyword": "Integration, Congruence, Success, Weight of the World on Your Shoulders",
    "details":"The World typically represents integration of our being in that our emotional, mental, creative and material lives are all working congruently. All the aspects of our lives are working in concert after a journey of hard work allowing us to arrive at a place of accomplishment. That said, the context of this card, and any card for that matter, can change dramatically dependent on the circumstances of your reading and where this card occurs in the spread. For example, this card can show that one feels the weight of the world on her shoulders and no matter what she does, her hands are full. Some references only provide a positive interpretation for this card, but we must listen to the cards and be receptive to the whole spectrum concepts represented."

Here we may have the first inklings of feelings about something or perhaps we privately entertain ourselves through revery and daydreams about it. Our feelings are not yet ripe to act upon and in fact, there is the possibility that we never act upon them. We can stagnate here and never move beyond the current state."

The other end of this spectrum is apathy and a lack of libido or chemistry with another."

    "details":"The Four of Cups, like the other fours, denotes stability but as this is the cups, it is in the realm of emotion. On one end of the spectrum is stability and comfort in one's emotional life, possibly with the potential to make more of the situation. On the other end of the spectrum, one might have gotten stuck and feel trapped, though upon closer inspection, we see we are stuck because of a lack of belief in ourselves. We always have choices. We may not want to make them, but they are there, even in difficult situations. "

We may find ourselves more inspired or renewed in our spiritual path or in a whole new experience altogether. On the other end of this energy is the feeling of disappointment and abandonment. In this card, we must be careful of going overboard. "

    "keyword": "Idealizing the Other, Narcissism, Thinking we've found perfection",
    "details":"The six of Cups is a connection with what we might consider our perfect match in that we have this person ideally constructed in our minds. While this person may indeed turn out to be ideal, we should check our minds and be honest with ourselves as a precaution. While this card shows us how we can find delight in others whom we consider ideal, it also teaches us compassion for the inescapable humanity of those we put on pedestals. Recall a time when someone you admired, possibly in an overly idealized way, revealed some aspect of themselves that was all too human and how they fell in your esteem, if only a little, for the simple fact of being human. Here, we must be careful that what really love is only ourselves."

    "details":"The seven of Cups is about taking our love and compassion into the world. We may be moved to try to improve the world in grand ways or in something as simple as saying a silent prayer for the wellbeing of a stranger. On the other hand, we can also be depressed by all the pain and suffering in the world becoming overwhelmed by it. The ideal of this card is found in generosity of spirit, patience, and unconditional kindness. When we are fearful of our own lack of power, we may act out against others, harboring ill will toward others for perceived transgressions."

    "details":"The Eight of Cups can denote the great depths that love can reach, where we have built upon true love of others and ourselves to an unconditional love for all of humanity. It can express itself in a genuinely caring relationship with our partner or a kind and stable relationship with our family. If selfishness is still present, we can fool ourselves into thinking our actions are for the benefit of others when in fact they are to suit our own agenda. It is here that we must remain vigilant, checking and rechecking our motivations."

    "details":"The Nine of Cups is associated with a time of mourning in which we must come to terms with releasing an old emotional habit so that we can make room for a new, deeper experience. The spiritual path, which necessarily includes love and an understanding of our emotional selves, is a process of ever-deepening consciousness. When we hold on to the past, difficult aspects of this energy can arise such as feeling overly nostalgic or fearfully resistant to change. We must embrace change. If we don't, it will be painful as we resist every step of the way because change will come, regardless of our desires."

    "details":"In the Ten of Cups, we have reached a culmination of emotional development in which we are now poised to take it to the next level, that is, to move it beyond the circle we've been operating within. Here, we approach the next stage of development in which we begin to act upon our feelings making manifest our desires. Alternatively, we can attempt to resist moving forward into the natural next stage. This card is very much the energy of thought-form moving into physicality. If we have harbored ill will, this is the result of that ill will and likewise, if we have cultivated loving kindness, this is that seed ripening."

    "card_group":"Minor Arcana",
    "keyword": "Private Emotions, Indecision, Consideration of Circumstances and Feelings",
    "details":"The Page of Cups can represent a person who is reserved or unsure when faced with the expanse of the emotional landscape. In various decks, this figure is depicted as somewhat androgynous. Though the clothes are 15th century Italian menswear, the wearer doesn't have a beard or overly masculine features and is wearing a garland of flowers. This page can also show a lack of trust or confidence in the situation or feelings. Where the knight is intrepid, the steps of the page are timorous. This can signify one who is emotionally androgynous, fitting into no clear cut, traditional role. It does not however, have to be a person who is obviously androgynous outwardly. It could also signify someone who is still considering the options or the lay of the land. Keep in mind that these are not necessarily negative traits but the state of either uncertainty or lack of commitment. Often, this is a time of deliberation. This card reminds us to respect this state in ourselves and others and consider its role in our lives."

He is fully mature in his emotions, having tempered his early passions with the wisdom of compassion. He no longer sees himself separate from others but he knows that whatever he does to others he does to himself. All that said, this card also warn against being generous to a fault or overextending ourselves. Consider the parent who is still coming to the rescue of a 30-year-old child in situations that the child should be able to handle or the friend who unwittingly enables another's detrimental behavior. This love calls for deep wisdom."

True to the nature of the number 2, it reflects accumulation, in this case, of terms that involve finances, home, health or physical family. This could range from closing on a home, signing your child up at a school, joining a gym, investing, or even finalizing a divorce. This is where agreements are made...or not made.

It is concerned with the investment of our currency (any kind of currency, not just money), our family, our health, our work, etc. We see its energy expressed in the birth of a child, in the rewards reaped from a new exercise regimen, or in the results of investment of any kind.

This can lay the foundation for a new phase in our lives. For example, when a couple is physically and financially secure, they often consider buying a home, having a child (in some cases getting a pet!) or making a significant financial investment. This card does not mean these things are happening, but that the circumstances are right for them to. The risk in this card is becoming complacent about your comfort and never forging ahead. Relationships can become repetitive and while comfortable as an old pair of shoes, lacking in vitality and spontaneity."

Consider the Pope(V) and Devil(XV) and apply that lens to the domain of the material, that is, of the Pentacles. We may become interested in a new area that we feel somehow will guide us to redemption or truth such as a new spiritual direction, tarot (or any path that has a material aspect such as runes, palmistry, any kind of forecasting, astrology, etc.), or going to spiritual gatherings or a house of worship. On the other end of the spectrum, we may seek escapism through any form of addiction. Addiction can be to obvious things such as drugs or alcohol, but includes addictive habits of any sort that allow you to put off those things in your life you know you need to address.

    "name":"Six of Pentacles",
    "shortname":"Pent_6",
    "card_group":"Minor Arcana",
    "keyword": "Mirror, narcissism, vanity, pride, humility, admiration, infatuation, hatred",
    "details":" The Six of Pentacles brings to the forefront that which we often overlook in ourselves. When we see another as perfection yet when they do something in a way that differs from how we wouldn't do it and we disapprove, we have set up a rule: 'as long as you are like me, you are perfect'. The moment they step out of line, they have fallen in our esteem. This has nothing to do with the other and everything to do with ourselves. It is an expression of pride and vanity. As such, realizing this perspective in ourselves, helps us address it and work toward developing humility. Imagine a behavior like this as a fulcrum - you can go either way with it. You can indulge it, feeding your narcissism and what can fester into hatred and resentment or you can seek to root it out and replace it with humility. Examine every thought, every word, every desire for this element within yourself and choose your path. While this card can make us think of mirrors and vanity within ourselves, it is also a mirror held before us. The Six is made of two equal Threes, both of which lead to further development. You can choose the path of that which manifests from pride or that which manifests from humility. At the same time, this card can be connected with all forms of physical pleasure. While there is pleasure in humility, there is a (perceived) pleasure in pride. There is also pleasure in all things of the senses - music, fragrances, visual beauty, texture, and food. Why do we enjoy these things? How can we deepen our experience through examining our reasons?"

    "keyword": "Athleticism, exercise, physical healing, medicine, herbalism",
    "details":"In the number Seven, we see the Chariot(VII) and the Star(XVII) expressed in materiality. We have reached a point where we have everything we need to share our inspiration with others. This can be expressed in things such as superior athleticism, physical healing, medicine and any earth related science that leads to helping others, even if only through quiet research. There is an integration in this card that is the bringing together of what we have worked hard to achieve and the next step of taking it out into the world to benefit others. On the other end of the spectrum we may withdraw or become disconnected, having become lost in a perceived wound or analysis. Alternatively, we can go out into the world, armed with special knowledge with the intention of conquering and subjugating."

    "keyword": "Security, money and attachment to it",
    "details":"The Eight of Pentacles is about security when it comes to all things material, including our bodies. It can reflect a strong attachment to money (or that with which we buy our way), either in wanting it or in vilifying it. Either way, money or currency (these can vary widely from one another) is a major element in one's experience when this card appears in a spread. Ideally, this card represents financial and physical accomplishment. This card is intimately connected with power and how we wield it - are we doing all we can or are we intentionally holding back?"

    "name":"Nine of Pentacles",
    "shortname":"Pent_9",
    "card_group":"Minor Arcana",
    "keyword": "Birth, major material change",
    "details":"The Nine of Pentacles builds on the foundation that was acheived in the Eight of Pentacles where we were secure in all things material. The energy of Nine can feel like divine intervention or an absolute crisis, both of which bring about something altogether new. We realize, through this energy, that our attachments are not the route to new consciousness. The energy of Nine in the Pentacles can herald the birth of a child, new construction, a financial upheaval (positive or negative) or some other major  material transformation. We can be completey overwhelmed by this energy as a swimmer caught unaware of a huge wave or we can choose to handle it with grace and skill like an expert surfer. Examples of this card in action could be loss of a fortune, birth, sudden acquisition of a gym (by inheritance, for example), or purchase or loss of a house among many other things."

    "card_group":"Minor Arcana",
    "keyword": "End of one cycle with the implication of beginning another, resistance to change",
    "details":"The Ten of Pentacles is a state in which we have enjoyed material life but times are changing and we don't want to let go of the past. Seeking permanence in a life that is defined ultimately by change is a mission doomed to failure. When we get stuck in rut, we need to get up and make a change, especially if what we are holding on to has passed. In this sitation we need to get creative. We have the resources to effect change whether or not we think we do. Resources can refer to many things - money, emotional strength, intelligence, physical resources, etc. When this card appears, check to see if you are resisting change when it is due. Complacency leads to stagnation, and like a dam bursting, stagnation will, in the end give way. The lesson in this card is to not hold on to things that cannot be held."

    "details":"The Page of Pentacles is young, inexperienced and unsure. He has what he needs to advance, but is held back. He wants to move forward, as signified by the pentacle in his right hand but his feet make no decisive movement. This card denotes potential in the buried pentacle but lack of commitment in the body language of the figure. The Page of Pentacles calls for care, deliberation and decisive action in regards to your material and financial welfare."

    "details":"The Queen of Pentacles can be trustworthy and resourceful. She is the most practical of the Queens and a natural with all things related to the Earth element such as gardening, herbalism, nurturing, hospitality and dependabilty. At the same time, she may be slow to change however, when she does change it can be as big and as sudden as a landslide - so whatever you do don't get in the way. She isn't one to be tricked by rhetoric or led into pipe dream adventures. She is concerned about what will take care of those she cares about. She cares about her environment and her home, whaterver that may be and those who she considers under her care."

    "details":"The King of Pentacles is the yang energy to the yin energy of the Queen of Pentacles. Where she is concerned with that which is in her personal environment, he has his eye on the whole domain. He is a business man, making money with the ease of an old pro. He isn't huslting. He's experienced and adept at providing for himself and his subjects, whomever they may be (family, loyal employees, etc). With a magnanimus tendancy, he might be the CEO who makes genuine efforts to help the less fortunate. However, if he has shady proclivities, he may be involved in money laundering or backroom dealings. The bottom line for the King of Pentacles is exactly that - the bottom line. How he gets it and how he uses it can vary widely. No matter what, he's good at coming out on top."

His horse is surefooted and he carries a baton, or wand for his journey. The knight is the yang to the yin of the Page. Where the Page of Pentacles is unsure about how to use his resources, the Knight sets out in full confidence and vigor. He may refer to a move such as moving house or a business as well as a new creative venture."

    "name":"Ace of Swords",

    "keyword": "Truth, justice, intellectual potential",
    "details":"The Ace of Swords holds in it the full potential of the suit of Swords. The Swords are associated with the element of Air and as such with thought, speech, clarity, communication, justice, truth, and writing to name a few. One of the supreme powers of the Swords is the ability to view an issue objectively and follow the thought process to its logical conclusion. Though thinking allows us to delve deeply, it also provides an environment for the ego to develop. In the case of faulty premises, we come to conclusions that often feed the ego to the detriment of justice. Weilding somethng as powerful as a sword requires skill as well as compassion. The mistletoe represents love and friendship while the palm signifies victory. The two branches are extending from a crown, implying divine blessing and the sword, representing the mental faculties, extends upward, through the crown, its tip echoing the tip of the cup in the Ace of Cups. The journey of the Swords teaches us how true triumph of the intellect requires the heart."

    "details":"The Two of Swords is a state of mental preparation or accumulation. From outward appearances, it may seem that there is little going on, however, inwardly there is a great deal. The energy of Two is one of collecting and the danger of it lies in collecting without end or purpose. We may read every book ever published on a topic and attend all the workshops on it, but if we never apply that knowledge, what purpose has it served? This card asks us to examine our reasons for our inaction. Are we avoiding something? If so, what is it and why are we avoiding it?"

    "details":"The Three of Swords is an explosion of conviction, whether it is based in fact or not. The energy of Three is dynamic and intense but lacks the fullness of completion. It is like the energy of the young adult who creates rules on how life should be, or is, with or without substantive premises or experience. It is a going forth of energy without wisdom or often, focus."

    "card_group":"Minor Arcana",
    "keyword": "Conservative thinking, traditional ideas, fixed perspective",
    "details":"The Four of Swords symbolizes stability or a fixed nature in the world of thoughts. It can symbolize a school of thought in a closed system where is little room for new ideas in the structure. It can also represent achievement of a base level of education, such as acheiving a university degree. The degree is not an end in and of itself, but merely the foundation upon which further development is cultivated. The Four of Swords can bring the comfort of traditional ways or the suffocating limitations of extreme conservatism that refuses change and growth. If this energy stagnates (a danger of fours) it can give rise to fear-based behavior. "
